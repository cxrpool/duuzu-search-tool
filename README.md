All you need is python 3 (any version) to run this (tkinter comes with python)

- By default the tool enables key/bpm search, where you type in a key formatted like Amaj or Amin and a bpm to search for songs in that key and close to that bpm. 
  Results are sorted by how close they are to the bpm. The threshold box is how many bpm away the results go.
- Click on the lower checkbox to enable title search, where you can search for a song title using keywords.
  Clicking on a result in this mode will change your bpm and key search to that of the selected song

-For both modes, double clicking on a result will open a Google tab with the title of the song so you can easily view it. Sorry duckduckgo users
